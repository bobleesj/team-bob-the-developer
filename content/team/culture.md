It is not the easiest job to manage a group of individuals at different time zones. Most of us have a have full-time job. It is important to maintain a few protocols to keep each other accountable so that we may step forward one at a time.

**1. Driven by deadlines:** When we work remotely, it is imperative that we set the expectation clear. On a weekly basis, we schedule for the next meeting along with the tasks to be completed. We catch up via Google Hangout.

**2. Experience does not matter, content does:** You are encouraged to write on a topic that you have no prior experience with. You overcome by conducting immense research and producing great content. I've started my blogging journey with no prior experience in coding. As you've heard, teaching is the best way not only to learn, but also to retain the most. However, it is conditioned that you've researched more than anyone else in the chosen topic.

**3. Pursue quality over quantity:** We live in a noisy world include notifications, emails, and so on. You are encouraged to go deep. When you aim for quality, metrics in forms of comments, shares, and recommendations, will speak for themselves.
