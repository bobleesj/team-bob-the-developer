Bob the Developer is someone who has big dream and wants to create a phenomenal product for the world. Before releasing to the world, products have to be phenomenal.

## Expansion
> What should I do to bring people on board?

I need to create a website where people can post articles and add translated version of anything. I'd also need to create a weekly newsletter for people to find more about the content. If the news letter goes well, I'd get sponsors from companies to promote.
